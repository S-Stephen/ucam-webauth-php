0.51 2008-04-28 JML 

 * Added support for (mandatory) hostname option, which can be set via the 
   constructor or the hostname get/set method
 * Fixed potential security issue, which arose due to failure to use a
   reliable source of hostname when reconstructing the current URL for use in
   various redirects and checks
 * Added redirection to the "correct URL" (before authentication) if the
   configured hostname does not match the hostname in the request's Host: 
   header, to tackle some consequences of inconsistent/varying choice of
   hostname in URLs for the site.
 * Failure to define cookie_key when using Ucam_Webauth sesssions is now
   reported properly as an error (via status code and message text).

   [Note that the hostname-related security issues affecting V0.5 and
   earlier also affect versions 0.6 (Nov 2007) & 0.61 (early April
   2008) which were distributed only as part of Raven authentication
   support for phpBB3. However, since those versions are significantly
   different from 0.5, version 0.51 cannot be used as a drop-in
   replacement for 0.6 or 0.61.]

0.5 2005-03-22 JW

* No code changes - assorted comment and text alterations to make it
  clear that the module is distributed under the GNU LGPL.

0.4 2005-01-27 JW

* Fixed yet another problem that could result in 'pre-expired' session
  cookies when run on a plaform with an inaccurate clock even if
  clock_skew was set correctly

0.3 2005-01-24 JW

* Previous fix didn't seem to resolve the odity with ksort/implode not
  always working. Added code to assemble cookies by hand to work round
  this

0.2 2005-01-23 JW

* Dropped bogus SESSION_TICKET_KEY field from session ticket, and 
  initialised the SESSION_TICKET_ver field. One or the other or both
  of these seems to cure a problem in which ksort (at least in PHP
  4.3.10) doesn't and which results in corrupt session cookies.

* Ignore empty/zero $WLS_TOKEN_LIFE field in WLS response. Failing to
  do so caused all error responses (including 'User Cancelled') to
  result in an immediate return to the WLS with a message about an
  expired local session. 

* Fixed typo: $SESSIOM_TICKET_PARAMS -> $SESSION_TICKET_PARAMS

* Added missing property 'fail' and a get/set routine for it 

* Added a 'band-aid' check for the likely case of the certificate file
  not being found or readable, but all the error handeling here needs
  re-working.

* Added an error_log entry if the local session has expired

0.1 (28/0404)

. First working version
